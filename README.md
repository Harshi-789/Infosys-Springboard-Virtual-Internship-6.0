Gaining practical experience in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🤖 Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by computer systems. It enables machines to:

Learn from data (Machine Learning)

Adapt to new inputs (Deep Learning)

Perform human-like tasks such as prediction, speech recognition, and decision-making

AI is the foundation for building intelligent systems capable of reasoning, problem-solving, and learning autonomously.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

📊 Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI focused on enabling systems to automatically learn from data without being explicitly programmed.

It involves:

Training models using historical data

Identifying hidden patterns

Making accurate predictions or classifications

🧩 Applications:

Predicting stock prices

Detecting spam emails

Classifying diseases

Segmenting customers based on behavior

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🧩 Python Libraries Used

🧮 NumPy

A fundamental library for scientific computing in Python.

Provides efficient multi-dimensional arrays and mathematical functions

Used for matrix operations, linear algebra, and vectorized computations

🔹 Example: Matrix operations, numerical computations, and array transformations.

🧾 Pandas

Powerful data manipulation and analysis library built on NumPy.

Handles structured data with DataFrames

Useful for data cleaning, transformation, and EDA

🔹 Example: Handling missing values, filtering datasets, and summarizing data.

📉 Matplotlib

A core library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

Ideal for data trends, patterns, and comparative analysis

Customizable plots (bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, etc.)

🔹 Example: Visualizing relationships or trends in datasets.

🌈 Seaborn

Built on top of Matplotlib, it offers a high-level interface for statistical graphics.

Simplifies data visualization with clean and aesthetic plots
