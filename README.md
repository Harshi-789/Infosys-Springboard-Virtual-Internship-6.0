Implementing basic algorithms like clustering and data analysis

All projects are written in Python using libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

🤖 What is Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence means making computers think and act like humans.
AI helps systems to:

Learn from data

Make decisions

Adapt to new situations

Examples: voice assistants, recommendation systems, and chatbots.

📊 What is Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a part of AI that teaches computers to learn from data without being directly programmed.
It helps to find patterns and make predictions.

Examples:

Predicting prices

Classifying emails as spam or not

Grouping similar items or users

🧩 Python Libraries Used
🧮 NumPy

Used for working with numbers, arrays, and mathematical operations.
✅ Example: performing matrix operations and calculations.

🧾 Pandas

Used for handling and analyzing data easily.
✅ Example: reading CSV files, cleaning missing values, and exploring data.

📉 Matplotlib

Used for creating graphs and charts to see data visually.
✅ Example: plotting bar charts, line charts, and scatter plots.

🌈 Seaborn

Used for advanced and beautiful data visualizations.
✅ Example: visualizing relationships and distributions between features.

⚙️ Machine Learning Topics

1️⃣ Classification

Used to group data into categories.
🧩 Example: Predicting whether an email is spam or not.

2️⃣ Regression

Used to predict continuous values.
🧩 Example: Predicting house prices or salaries.

3️⃣ Clustering

Used to group similar data points together.
🧩 Example: Dividing customers into groups based on buying behavior.
